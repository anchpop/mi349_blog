    <p>Hi! I'm Andre and this is my blog.</p>
    <p>
      I have many posts of many topics. Too many to list here, even if the list
      were numbered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe you're wondering about my list of credentials. You expected to see a
      list of them in here? Well I don't have any, so too bad!
    </p>
    <p>Here's a selfie though: <img src="/pictures/selfie.jpg" /></p>
    And here's a list of my favorite numbers!
    <ol>
      <li>9</li>
      <li>2</li>
      <li>1</li>
      <li>5</li>
      <li>7</li>
    </ol>
