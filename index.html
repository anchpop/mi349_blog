          In my new co-op I have a bunch of plants in a room we call...
          <strong>the plant room</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't know any of their names or anything because I'm not really
          into plants. But it is nice to have some nature around.
        </p>

          This plant is one of my favorites. It has these little nubby things on
          it that I think are really pretty.

          Over here we have the plant shelf. It kind of sucks and is probably
          just a few weeks away from total collapse. It's kind of hard to see in
          the picture but it's completely tilted.

          Over here we have a nice and tall plant. It sits in the corner and is
          a nice companion when you're in the chair getting some homework done
          as I am right now.

          This last plant I don't like very much. It's kind of ugly and
          disgusting and almost dead. The person who's in charge of watering the
          plants doesn't know how much to water any of them so she just does
          random amounts and I think in this case that was not a good strategy.

          So I'm basically an HTML expert now. In my long career I've learned
          many things and would like to share my wisdom with you here.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Remember to close your tags. You open it, you close it. No
              exceptions

          </li>

              Math is great. But it has no place on the internet. NEVER say one
              number is greater or less than another - it will destroy your
              whole page's html. If you absolutely must, write '&amp;lt;' it
              will appear as '&lt;'.
            </p>
            <p>
              But why are you making a website about math anyway? Have you
              considered doing literally anything else instead?
            </p>

              Don't forget to remind HTML that you're writing HTML by putting
              &lt;html&gt; at the top and bottom of your HTML. Otherwise it may
              get confused and think you're writing markup in one of the many
              other markup languages available for the web. Just kidding, there
              aren't any!
