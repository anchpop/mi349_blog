        In my new co-op I have a bunch of plants in a room we call...
        <strong>the plant room</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know any of their names or anything because I'm not really
        into plants. But it is nice to have some nature around.
      </p>
      <p>
        This plant is one of my favorites. It has these little nubby things on
        it that I think are really pretty.

        Over here we have the plant shelf. It kind of sucks and is probably
        just a few weeks away from total collapse. It's kind of hard to see in
        the picture but it's completely tilted.

      </p>
      <p>
        Over here we have a nice and tall plant. It sits in the corner and is
        a nice companion when you're in the chair getting some homework done
        as I am right now.

        This last plant I don't like very much. It's kind of ugly and
        disgusting and almost dead. The person who's in charge of watering the
        plants doesn't know how much to water any of them so she just does
        random amounts and I think in this case that was not a good strategy.

      <p>
        So I'm basically an HTML expert now. In my long career I've learned
        many things and would like to share my wisdom with you here.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Remember to close your tags. You open it, you close it. No
            exceptions
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Math is great. But it has no place on the internet. NEVER say one
            number is greater or less than another - it will destroy your
            whole page's html. If you absolutely must, write '&amp;lt;' it
            will appear as '&lt;'.
          </p>
          <p>
            But why are you making a website about math anyway? Have you
            considered doing literally anything else instead?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Don't forget to remind HTML that you're writing HTML by putting
            &lt;html&gt; at the top and bottom of your HTML. Otherwise it may
            get confused and think you're writing markup in one of the many
            other markup languages available for the web. Just kidding, there
            aren't any!
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Some HTML elements are "block-level" by default. This means they start on a new line and take up as much width
        as it can. Additionally, some elements are considered 'semantic'. These
        give metadata to the browser about what type of information is contained within.</p>

      <p>Here is a table to help you know which is which</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Tag</th>
          <th>Block-level</th>
          <th>Semantic</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>span</td>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>div</td>
          <td>✔️</td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>address</td>
          <td>✔️</td>
          <td>✔️</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>article</td>
          <td>✔️</td>
          <td>✔️</td>
        </tr>

          <td>✔️</td>
          <td>✔️</td>
        </tr>

          <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>table</td>
          <td>✔️</td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>mark</td>
          <td></td>
          <td>✔️</td>
        </tr>
